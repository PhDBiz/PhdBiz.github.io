Hello friends!

First of all, I am just another guy like you who is suffering from the disease named "THE PhD". 
When some half-educated people hear this word "PhD" their reaction is "wow! great" on the outside, but remember what they could be thinking inside could be totally different, you know what I mean. All they are thinking is what a menial job (salary). 

Then there are other type of people who just nod for no good reason, and that is just because they don't get all this crap about research  (again thinking about your salary).  Then come the peers, people who are friends and so-calleds, they just look at you and flaunt all that they have  (again what can I say!).

Although all these people have different levels of stupidity and intellect, they share a common virtue, they look at you and they don't see any hopes for you to be getting financially strong in any near future see-able.

And this very fact that how the society is looking at the research people like us, fills me with  all sorts of emotions, to name a few anxiety, panic, envy, anger (raag), and most of all shame on both the parties involved.

Anyway, I am starting this blog to write about anything that I think is relevant for PhD students starting from emotional stories, sufferings, pain and misery etc. No no no. don't worry I am just kidding, this blog is to provide you with the stuff that can earn you some money in future I hope.
Basically, my thesis of some businesses, which would give you ideas and recipes to invest.


Thanks!

Regards! ;)
